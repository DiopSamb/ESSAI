The inherent complexity presented by the vast IoT ecosystem ends up in an insufficient understanding of individual system components and their interactions, leading to numerous security challenges. In order to create a secure IoT platform from the ground up, there is a need for a unifying operating system (OS) that can act as a cornerstone regulating the development of stable and secure solutions. In this paper, we present a classification of the security challenges stemming from the manifold aspects of IoT development. We also specify security requirements to direct the secure development of an unifying IoT OS to resolve many of those ensuing challenges. Survey of several modern IoT OSs confirm that while the developers of the OSs have taken many alternative approaches to implement security, we are far from engineering an adequately secure and unified architecture. More broadly, the study presented in this paper can help address the growing need for a secure and unified platform to base IoT development on and assure the safe, secure, and reliable operation of IoT in critical domains.","2023-10-27","2025-10-21 06:59:49","2025-10-21 06:59:49","2025-10-21 06:59:39","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2310.19825 [cs]","","C:\Users\bathi\Zotero\storage\S9XZXMUE\Jawad - 2023 - A Survey of the Security Challenges and Requirements for IoT Operating Systems.pdf","","","Computer Science - Cryptography and Security; Computer Science - Operating Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2310.19825","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, its extensive and feature-rich API interface exposes a broad attack surface, making K8s vulnerable to exploits of software vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Even if K8s adopts role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to K8s APIs, this approach lacks the granularity needed to protect specification attributes within API requests. This paper proposes a novel solution, KubeFence, which implements finer-grain API filtering tailored to specific client workloads. KubeFence analyzes Kubernetes Operators from trusted repositories and leverages their configuration files to restrict unnecessary features of the K8s API, to mitigate misconfigurations and vulnerabilities exploitable through the K8s API. The experimental results show that KubeFence can significantly reduce the attack surface and prevent attacks compared to RBAC.","2025-06-23","2025-10-21 17:55:17","2025-10-21 17:55:17","2025-10-21 17:55:08","497-510","","","","","","KubeFence","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2504.11126 [cs]","","C:\Users\bathi\Zotero\storage\J9W4HDI9\Cesarano et Natella - 2025 - KubeFence Security Hardening of the Kubernetes Attack Surface.pdf","","","Computer Science - Cryptography and Security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
